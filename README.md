# [Unsplash clone]('https://anyalyalya.github.io/unsplash-clone') 

## Description

This project is a simple web gallery that serves as a mini Unsplash clone. It allows users to browse and search for images using the Unsplash API. The gallery displays a strip of images with options to switch between 3-column and 5-column layouts. Pagination is implemented for navigating through the image strip. Clicking on an image leads to a page with additional information about the image, including a description, tags, likes, and author details. Clicking on a tag from the individual image page takes the user to a collection of images with that tag. The site has a responsive and adaptive design, following the UI style of Unsplash. The project is built using React.js, with styling done in SCSS.
